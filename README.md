# Monte Carlo Empirical Orthogonal Function (MCEOF) Code
This repository contains code for Monte Carlo Empirical Orthogonal Function analysis of many time-uncertain proxy records used in Anchukaitis and Tierney 2013.  Please note that there is now a more generalized implementation of our procedure (there called '`MCPCA`) in the (Pyleoclim)[https://github.com/LinkedEarth/Pyleoclim_util] package
