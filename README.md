# Monte Carlo Empirical Orthogonal Function (MCEOF) Code
This repository contains MATLAB code for Monte Carlo Empirical Orthogonal Function (MCEOF) analysis of many time-uncertain proxy paleoclimate records described in Anchukaitis and Tierney 2013.  Please note that there is now a more generalized implementation of our procedure (there called `MCPCA` instead of `MCEOF`) in the [Pyleoclim](https://github.com/LinkedEarth/Pyleoclim_util) package.  [Rebecca Orrison](https://github.com/rgorrison) also implemented the procedure [here](https://github.com/rgorrison/sams-mcoef).
